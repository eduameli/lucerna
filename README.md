# Lucerna (renderer)
## warning: **very** wip, dont use this code as reference.
## gitlab https://gitlab.com/eduameli/lucerna  

my goals for this project is to make a cool renderer (not a game engine)
to keep it simple i have some constraints
- can only handle one scene at a time (drop everything and rebuild to switch scenes)
- only one graphics api (vulkan)
- only support a subset of (modernish) hardware
- dont overlap with future planned project
- no bikeshedding allowed

## general requirements
must be robust and performant!  

## should have
texture compression, automatic pipeline layout, multithreading, nice editor, configurable.

## must have
oit, forward clustered, csm, baked lighting, anti aliasing, hiz culling, skinned meshes, basic pbr  
demos to tweak the settings and see the effects in action! -> README.md screenshots
