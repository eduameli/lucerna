# Lucerna (renderer)

my goals for this project is to make a cool renderer (not a game engine)
to keep it simple i have some constraints
- can only handle one scene at a time (drop everything and rebuild to switch scenes)
- only one graphics api *(vulkan)*
- only support a subset of hardware
- dont overlap with future planned project
- no bikeshedding

## general requirements
must be robust and performant! as it will be part of the portfolio. 

## should have
texture compression, automatic pipeline layout, multithreading, nice editor

## must have
oit, forward clustered, csm, baked lighting, anti aliasing, hiz culling, skinned meshes, basic pbr  
demos to tweak the settings and see the effects in action! -> README.md screenshots
